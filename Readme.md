# File Navigator for Sublime Text 2/3

This plugin lets You quickly navigate through your project and perform basic file operations
just using your keyboard (something that many of us missed when moving from VIM).

Things you can do with this plugin are:

	- create new files and directories
	- copy/move/paste existing files/directories
	- rename existing files
	- delete existing files

All of the operations above are done using the excellent sublime quick panel window. This means you get all the usual benefits of that including fuzzy name matching.

## Usage
