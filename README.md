# File Navigator plugin for Sublime Text 2/3

This plugin lets You quickly navigate through your project and perform basic file operations
just using your keyboard (something that many of us missed when moving from VIM).

## Code base
The initial idea of this package came from by Tomasz Grabowski. Thanks for that :)
